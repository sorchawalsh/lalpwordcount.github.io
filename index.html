    GROUP 1: (.*?) --> matches anything before the tag word, lazy. Not necessarily essential to
             have as a match group but it doesn't hurt, plus this way we can change our mind about
             how we want to count things afterwards a bit more easily if need be.
             EDIT 27.09.2021: i did change my mind. we now count the number of words.
    GROUP 2: (REPLACES) --> pretty straightforward, detects the tag word "REPLACES".
    GROUP 3: (.+?(?=\^\])) --> This looks worse than it is. Matches one or more of any character,
             but no more than necessary (.+?). Then there's a positive lookahead: (?=\^\]) which will
             ensure that it stops where it should. Not strictly necessary to have the lookahead, but
             its a nice way to make sure we don't accidentally match ^].
